Programming Assignment 2 -SQL for Data Science
=======
**DUE DATE: March 10th, Wednesday, 11pm**

In this assingments you are asked to complete a serious of SQL activities defined within a IPython Notebook. Please download the `SQL-assingments2` notebook and the `assignment2.db` files. The assingment is described in the notebook. Please read the instructions below before you start working on it. 

### Instructions / Notes:

**_Read these carefully_**

* **IMPORTANT**: In your terminal run `pip install --user --upgrade ipython-sql`. This will install the necessary sql packages for Jupyter notebook.
* Make sure the actual database file, `assignment2.db`, is in the same directory as this IPython notebook is running in
* Some of the problems involve _changing_ this database (e.g. deleting rows)- you can always re-download `assignment2.db` or make a copy if you want to start fresh!
* You **may** create new IPython notebook cells to use for e.g. testing, debugging, exploring, etc.- this is encouraged in fact!- **just make sure that your final answer for each question is _in its own cell_ and _clearly indicated_**
* When you see `In [*]:` to the left of the cell you are executing, this means that the code / query is _running_.
    * **If the cell is hanging- i.e. running for too long: To restart the SQL connection, you must restart the entire python kernel**
    * To restart kernel using the menu bar: "Kernel >> Restart >> Clear all outputs & restart"), then re-execute the sql connection cell at top
    * You will also need to restart the connection if you want to load a different version of the database file
* Remember:
    * `%sql [SQL]` is for _single line_ SQL queries
    * `%%sql [SQL]` is for _multi line_ SQL queries
* _Have fun!_

### Submission Instructions 

Submit the notebook with your solutions and the database file.
